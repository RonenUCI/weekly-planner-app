# Jewish Holidays Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated Jewish holidays from the Hebcal ICS feed into the weekly planner app, alongside existing school events and family activities.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Refactored Calendar Scraping Architecture**
- **Created `ICSCalendarScraper` base class** (`ics_calendar_scraper.py`)
  - Provides reusable ICS parsing logic
  - Handles common operations like downloading, parsing, and converting to planner format
  - Defines abstract methods that subclasses must implement

### 2. **Updated Existing School Scraper**
- **Refactored `SchoolCalendarScraper`** (`kid_school_scraper.py`)
  - Now inherits from `ICSCalendarScraper`
  - Removed duplicate code (session management, CSV operations, etc.)
  - Maintains all existing functionality for JLS and Ohlone schools

### 3. **Added Jewish Holidays Scraper**
- **Created `JewishHolidaysScraper`** (`jewish_holidays_scraper.py`)
  - Downloads from Hebcal ICS feed: `https://download.hebcal.com/v4/CAEQARgBIAEoATABQAGAAQGYAQGgAQH4AQU/hebcal.ics`
  - Parses Jewish holidays, observances, and Shabbat
  - Categorizes events (Major Holiday, Minor Holiday, Fast Day, Weekly Observance, etc.)
  - Assigns appropriate locations (Home, Synagogue, Home/Synagogue)

### 4. **Created Unified Calendar Scraper**
- **Added `UnifiedCalendarScraper`** (`unified_calendar_scraper.py`)
  - Combines multiple calendar sources into one workflow
  - Can scrape school events and Jewish holidays simultaneously
  - Provides options to merge with existing activities or save separately

### 5. **Updated Main Application**
- **Modified `app.py`**
  - `load_combined_data_for_display()` now loads three data sources:
    - `activities.csv` (family activities - editable)
    - `school_events.csv` (school events - read-only)
    - `jewish_holidays.csv` (Jewish holidays - read-only)
  - All sources are combined for display in weekly schedule
  - Family activities remain editable while calendar events are read-only

### 6. **Added Testing and Verification**
- **Created `test_jewish_integration.py`**
  - Verifies that Jewish holidays are properly loaded
  - Tests the combined data loading function
  - Confirms integration works as expected

## Data Flow

```
ICS Feeds → Scrapers → CSV Files → App Integration → Display
     ↓           ↓         ↓           ↓           ↓
  Hebcal    Jewish     jewish_    load_combined  Weekly
  Schools   Holidays   holidays   _data_for_     Schedule
  (JLS/     Scraper   .csv       _display()     (575 total
  Ohlone)              (383)      (575 total     events)
                       events)    events)
```

## Current Data Counts

- **Family Activities**: 24 entries (editable)
- **School Events**: 168 entries (JLS + Ohlone)

- **Total Combined**: 575 events

## Key Features

### **Jewish Holidays Integration**
- All Jewish holidays appear with "Jewish:" prefix in the schedule

### **Unified Display**
- Weekly schedule shows all three event types together
- Events are color-coded and organized by day
- Addresses are clickable Google Maps links
- Summary calculations include all event types

### **Maintainable Architecture**
- Base class provides common functionality
- Each scraper handles its specific data source
- Easy to add new calendar sources in the future
- Clean separation of concerns

## Usage

### **Individual Scrapers**
```bash
# Scrape school events only
python3 kid_school_scraper.py

# Scrape Jewish holidays only  
python3 jewish_holidays_scraper.py
```

### **Unified Scraper**
```bash
# Scrape all sources at once
python3 unified_calendar_scraper.py
```

### **Testing Integration**
```bash
# Verify Jewish holidays are properly loaded
python3 test_jewish_integration.py
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Calendar Sources**
   - Sports leagues
   - Community events
   - Religious organizations

2. **Enhanced Categorization**
   - Color coding by event type
   - Filtering by event category
   - Priority levels for events

3. **Automated Updates**
   - Scheduled scraping
   - Webhook notifications
   - Change detection

## Files Added/Modified

### **New Files**
- `ics_calendar_scraper.py` - Base class for ICS scraping
- `jewish_holidays_scraper.py` - Jewish holidays scraper
- `unified_calendar_scraper.py` - Combined scraper
- `test_jewish_integration.py` - Integration test script
- `JEWISH_HOLIDAYS_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### **Modified Files**
- `kid_school_scraper.py` - Refactored to inherit from base class
- `app.py` - Updated to load Jewish holidays

### **Generated Files** (not committed)
- `jewish_holidays.csv` - Jewish holidays data
- `all_calendar_events.csv` - Combined calendar data

## Conclusion

The Jewish holidays integration successfully expands the weekly planner to include religious observances while maintaining the existing functionality for family activities and school events. The refactored architecture makes it easy to add more calendar sources in the future, and the unified display provides a comprehensive view of all scheduled activities.

The app now serves as a complete family calendar that includes:
- **Personal activities** (editable family events)
- **Institutional events** (school calendars)
- **Religious observances** (Jewish holidays)

All events are properly integrated, categorized, and displayed in a user-friendly weekly schedule format.
